# Library-Management-System-basics
* made by Esra Nur Özüm

In this project, the aim was to creat a basic management system where a user can add a product (book, etc.) to their account, delete a porduct from their account, and filter some product to see what are the products according to the several filtering options. On the other hand, admins can see each users products and can make some changes among them such as deleting the product, adding a product, deleting the user account adding new user to the system, etc.
